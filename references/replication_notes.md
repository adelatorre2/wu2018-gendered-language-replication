# Replication Materials

## Where I got the data and replication materials

I simply followed one of the first footnotes in the paper:

> Go to https://doi.org/10.1257/pandp.20181101 to visit the article page 
> for additional materials and author disclosure statement.

I then navigated the page and got to this [OpenICPSR page](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/114486/version/V1/view) where I downloaded the replication package materials.
